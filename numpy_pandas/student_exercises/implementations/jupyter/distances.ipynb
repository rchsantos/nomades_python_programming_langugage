    "## Some Recaps\n",
    "### Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The vectors are mathematic objects that represents a translation in 2D space. a translation is defined by three properties:\n",
    "- The sign (positive or negative)\n",
    "- The direction (orientation)\n",
    "- The length (length)\n",
    "\n",
    "The length of a vector is the **norm** of the vector. The norm of the vector is denoted with $||\\vec{v}||$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vectors are inside a d-plane, where d is the number of dimensions. (Here we'll use a 2d plane, so d=2). The vector space is defined by the vectors basis $[\\vec{i}, \\vec{j}]$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics the vectors should be added togethers. You can visualize it as this :\n",
    "\n",
    "![vec_add](imgs/vector_addition.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\vec{c}$ is the addition of the vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$. Visually we copy the vector $\\vec{b}$ to the end of $\\vec{a}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scalar Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, the vectors can be multiplied by a scalar. You can visualize it as this :\n",
    "\n",
    "![vec_mul](imgs/vector_scalar_mult.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "this operation is called the scalar product because it multiplies the vector by a scalar. **it scale the vector**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: If the scalar is negative, the vector will be reversed in the opposite direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Norms\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, the norm of a vector is the length of the vector. The norm of a vector is denoted with $||\\vec{v}||$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The norm is the square root of the sum of the squares of the two coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "$||\\vec{v}|| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, where $x$ and $y$ are the coordinates of the vector (the two components).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dot Product\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, the dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product is the scalar product of two vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = x_1 * x_2 + y_1 * y_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "the general formula is $ \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b} = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i * b_i$, where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are the coordinates $i$ of the vectors (the two components).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distances\n",
    "\n",
    "In Machine learning the concept of distance is important. The distances reprensents how far we are from a point. If we try to predict something we want to be as close as possible as a true point (ground truth).\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists multiple distances:\n",
    "- Manhattan distance (L1-Norm)\n",
    "- Euclidean distance (L2-Norm)\n",
    "- Dot product\n",
    "- cosine similarity\n",
    "\n",
